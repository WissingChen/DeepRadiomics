# DeepRadiomics
DeepRadiomics implements a deep learning generalization of the radiomics classification model using pytorch.

For more details, see full paper "<>".

## Running Experiments

To run an experiment, you should run preprocess.py first, then you will get a h5py file with all data.

Make a .ini file including some parameter such network structure and train it from main.py
